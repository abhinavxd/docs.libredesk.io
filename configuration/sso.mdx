Libredesk supports external OpenID Connect providers (e.g., Google, Keycloak) for signing in users.

<Note>
User accounts must be created in Libredesk manually; signup is not supported.
</Note>

## Generic Configuration Steps

Since each provider's configuration might differ, consult your provider's documentation for any additional or divergent settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provider setup">
    In your provider's admin console, create a new OpenID Connect application/client. Retrieve:
    - Client ID
    - Client Secret
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Libredesk configuration">
    In Libredesk, navigate to Security → SSO and click New SSO and enter the following details:
    - Provider URL (e.g., the URL of your OpenID provider)
    - Client ID
    - Client Secret
    - A descriptive name for the connection
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Redirect URL">
    After saving, copy the generated Callback URL from Libredesk and add it as a valid redirect URI in your provider's client settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>
